Aman Bansal
Startup Team Member | Sales Mentor | Process Improvement Advocate

About Me
I have been involved as a pilot team member and foundation team member for two distinct startups. I've witnessed firsthand how companies evolve from a room full of aspirations and ideas to fully operating businesses.

My expertise lies in establishing revenue growth through ARPU% maximization, aligning sales teams with individual conversion increments, and enhancing cross-departmental work processes. I have handled interviews for cross-departmental positions, provided training, and served as a mentor for junior managers and employees to facilitate sales method process modifications.

I oversee sales process performance and focus on team contributions, emphasizing the use of analytical and dynamic strategies to optimize sales and operations with the best use of available resources.
